# Sorting-Visualizer
In this project I have made a Simple visualizer which will help a beginner to understand how sorting algorithms work.
I have also included the feature in which a user can also resize the array for better understanding and deep visualization.
In the middle of the sorting all other buttons will be disabled except the speed of the soring, speed can be increased or decreased according to the requirement.
